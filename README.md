# Sonoff-Tasmota
I have tried integrating [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting) which uses [WS2812fx](https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX) to provide 50+ effects. If anyone is interested, you can clone and test my fork here. Change `my_led_config.h` file accordingly. To control the effects using MQTT, send payload to topic  `cmnd/sonoff`. To see results, subscribe to `stat/sonoff/LED`. Checkout this [API](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting/wiki/WebSocket-API) for how to send payload. Don't know if it messes up other sonoff code. If you don't want to compile, flash the file `firmware.bin` in this repo directly to your sonoff and you are good to go. File `modes.json` contains the list of all the effects you can have. A simple mqtt publish to topic `cmnd/sonoff` with payload `/<effectID>` will change the animation. Hope this helps someone!
